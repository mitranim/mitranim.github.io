Nelo Mitranim.

Lead software developer and architect. Main expertise: web applications (full stack). Decent expertise in some other areas (making tools, libraries, languages). Prefer greenfield development.

See [works](/works).

# Languages

Solid experience: Go, C, Rust, JS (DOM/Deno/Bun/Node), Clojure, Python, Forth, assembly.

Wrote a custom JIT compiler for Forth with support for self-assembly.

I maintain my own Go and JS "stdlibs", frameworks, many libraries.

* My Go stdlib: [https://github.com/mitranim/gg](https://github.com/mitranim/gg).
* My JS stdlib: [https://github.com/mitranim/js](https://github.com/mitranim/js).

Familiarity: C++, Nim, Haskell, Erlang, Common Lisp, Scheme, Java, Swift.

Enthusiastic about programming language design.

# Databases

Solid experience:

* SQL databases:
  * Postgres ([https://postgresql.org](https://postgresql.org)).
  * DuckDB ([https://duckdb.org](https://duckdb.org)).

Experience:

* Datomic ([https://www.datomic.com](https://www.datomic.com)).
* Firebase ([https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)).
* Document databases: ArangoDB, CouchDB.

Additional notes:

* Core data is always relational.
* SQL syntax is evil.

# Applications

* Hybrid SSR+SPA apps.
* Dynamic web apps (SPA).
* Traditional web apps (SSR + forms).
* Ethereum apps; see [github.com/purelabio/eth](https://github.com/purelabio/eth).
