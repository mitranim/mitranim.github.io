Welcome and/or welcome back!

This place is intended as a blog about programming and tech in general, possibly with a sprinkling of philosophy and entertainment. There was a burst of activity in 2015, followed by three and a half years of hiatus.

In 2019, I intend to blog regularly. I have a huge backlog of topics to cover and opinions to share. They roughly fall in the following categories:

* programming language design
* thoughts and observations on software development
* everything bad about software; downer warning!
* game and anime impressions
* game design from player perspective

It's possible to subscribe via [Feedly](https://feedly.com), but it currently fails to add new posts from this blog. I'm looking into resolving this.
