Updated definition: amount of decisions (brain) + amount of effort in muscle memory.

## Overview


This may sound incredibly obvious: more challenging games are more engaging. For a given definition of "challenge".

Challenge simultaneously attracts and repels, while lack of challenge bores. Too little challenge = too little attraction; you'll walk away bored. Too much challenge = too much repulsion; you'll be pushed away.






For lack of a better term, I'm attaching this to the word "gameplay". If you have a better idea, let me know, and I'll update the post.



This doesn't just apply to the entire game. It applies to its every minute. An average is not a good enough metric. A game might combine highs and lows, incredibly engaging moments and a boring slog.




Learned something new: _if a game bores you, raise the difficulty_. Get comfortable with failure. Crank it up until you can barely manage.

To keep your interest, a game can:

* be new to you
* provide a "goal challenge" with a failure mode
* provide a "creative challenge" without a failure mode

By "creative challenge", I'm referring to builder games like Minecraft, Subnautica or Astroneer that require you to come up with your own goals, find your own fun in the game's toolbox. Obviously, strategy games also provide a creative challenge, but for the purposes of this post, they count as "goal challenge".

When playing to relax, you probably want a creative challenge without a failure mode.



Without challenge, a game stays interesting only while you're learning it. Once familiar, it must provide a challenge.







## Overview

This post will:

* Observe a quality that makes games more engaging
* Propose a quantifiable definition for "gameplay"
* Provide examples
* Make suggestions to game developers

**This is an opinion piece.** Games are highly subjective. If we disagree, that's cool!

## Observation

This may seem incredibly obvious: games are interactive; the more you _interact_, the more _game_ there is.


## Definitions

For the lack of a better term, I'm attaching this to the word "gameplay". Feel free to suggest something more fitting.




## Overview



Rather than proposing a definition, this is an _observation_ of a useful characteristic of games.

This would partially but not fully overlap with "challenge". Interesting decisions don't have to be challenging.






I'm about to propose a quantifiable definition for "gameplay".

Note that _words have multiple meanings_. The definition of "gameplay" in this post might be useful for analytical discussions, but can in no way supplant the existing colloquial meanings. Also, **this is an opinion piece.** Games tend to be highly subjective. If we disagree, that's cool!

Also note that while I think about games analytically, I don't design them. This comes from a consumer rather than creator. I'd like to hear a developer's opinion on this.

## Definitions

I propose the following definition:

> The _amount of gameplay_ is the amount of thoughtful decisions or skillful performances demanded from the player.

It's also useful to talk about frequency, or density:

> _Gameplay density_ is the amount of thoughtful decisions or skillful performances demanded from the player per unit of time.

Let's further refine the definitions:

"Thoughtful" means "non-obvious", "not predetermined", "not known in advance". It means the decision required a non-zero amount of thinking on the spot.

"Demanded" means that it meaningfully affects the outcome, usually by making you more likely to win or lose.

## Consequences

Under this definition, "gameplay" correlates with "challenge".

Potential for skillful play that's not required to win a game seems to be a hazy ground. Depending on the player's drive to overperform, this may or may not constitute "gameplay". This also includes games without clearly defined goals such as Minecraft or Kerbal Space Program.

Conversely, what does _not_ constitute gameplay is predetermined decisions, such as pressing the forward button to continue.

One of the ways to maximize gameplay is by making game features double-edged.

By definition, the amount of gameplay is relative to the player. What's thoughtful or skillful for one, is a no-brainer for another.

## Showcase

### Diablo 3

Disclaimer: I've spent hundreds of hours in Diablo 3 and have a character in nearly the best attainable gear. This criticism is coming from a fan.

Diablo 3 has many features but surprisingly little gameplay. It's my go-to example of low gameplay density. It's highly polished and convenient to play, but simultaneously makes an amazing amount of game design mistakes.

Consider the environments. The ways they differ are purely aesthetic. Some are large open spaces, some mostly corridors and pathways, but navigating them always consists of left-clicking and holding the cursor away from the walls, which is an _obvious, predetermined decision_ with no skillful element. Navigation presents no challenge and no gameplay. Missed opportunities:

* vertical navigation, overlapping floors
* environments that differ in functionality, not just aesthetic
* mutually exclusive paths with non-obvious relative values, such as a harder path with more elites versus a safer path with a higher chance to spawn treasure chests
* environments with hazards compensated through risk-reward; for example, sprawling toxic clouds that drain your health while increasing your damage
* more?

### Darkest Dungeon

### Slay the Spire

* Adding a card can be negative; often you want to skip
* Adding a relic can be negative; sometimes you want to skip

## WIP Notes to Self

Consider making a video on this.

Consider making video examples and linking to them. Diablo 3 is so egregious!
