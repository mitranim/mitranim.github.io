# Overview

Doom Eternal (henceforth DE) by id Software (henceforth IDS)

Read my Doom 2016 [impressions]() and [tips & tricks]() articles.

**Aggressive resource management** (ARM).

**Marauders**.

My tips for making Marauders fun:

* Dash to retreat. Marauders run faster than other monsters, and will come to you first. This gives you a few seconds of one-on-one. Break line of sight while retreating to avoid their projectiles. When they spawn a wolf, retreating also makes it easier to kill the summon before engaging the Marauder.

* Keep the fodder demons around to replenish your supplies. Killing a Marauder might require your entire stock of Ballista and Super Shotgun ammo, and without fodder demons to resupply from, you might prematurely run out, which is fatal against this opponent. Make sure to also Flame Belch the fodder for armor. Use Ice Bombs and Frag Grenades to kill them without swapping guns; those cooldowns aren't useful against the Marauder himself anyway.

* In the vulnerability window, rapid-swap one-shot weapons such as Super Shotgun and Ballista. Swapping is faster than reloading.

**Buff totems and Arch-Viles**.

**Weapons**.

Special üëç for allowing _instant_ quickscope shots with Precision Bolt.

**Music**. The music fits. Subjectively, I'd prefer less rock and more metal, but it works. I really like some ambient tracks, and I haven't noticed any combat tracks grating on my ears, unlike Doom 2016.

# Vs. Doom 2016

* Improved, faster, harder, brutaler.

* Slightly more tactical, and you have to think _fast_!

* D2016 had ARM, DE doubled down on it.

# Aesthetics and Narrative

**Maykr architecture** feels like a careful mix of Tenno, Orokin, and Sentient stuff from Warframe. I wonder if IDS artists got influenced by those.

**Quake**. Aesthetically, Doom Eternal is mixed with Quake thanks to the Sentinel architecture, which combines gothic themes with high tech. They also call portals "slipgates", which is lifted straight from Quake. Historically, Doom's aesthetic was a stark contrast between spacefaring high tech and demonic magics. Doom Eternal blurs all the lines. YMMV; I suppose in the absense of single-player Quake games, we got Doom Eternal which is both Doom _and_ Quake.

# Nitpicks

At this point, **stop reading until you've played DE**. In this section, I will nitpick on the narrative and aesthetic aspects of a game that's 99% about ripping and tearing demons. This stuff probably won't affect your gameplay experience in any way. This also includes **minor spoilers**. I don't want to spoil your enjoyment.

**Hero vs. nobody**. D2016 and DE elevate the Doomguy, now called Doom Slayer, to a godlike figure, almost universally revered among all factions. I feel like they missed an important narrative point of the previous games, and missed it _hard_.

This isn't exclusive to Doom. Diablo 3 did the same.
