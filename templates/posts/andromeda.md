Very good. Solid sequel. Worthy successor. Note: the game got patched, addressing many release problems such as faces.

Multiplayer is non-functional. This article is about single player only.

## Overview

* Consistently good writing.
  * Has tiny blemishes that got overexposed by critics.
  * Good background work.
  * Many cool ideas. Easy to overlook.
  * Many competent characters.
  * Few plot holes. Many potential holes are successfully plugged.
* Good mechanics.
  * Advancements over ME1/2/3.
* Sold on the premise.
  * Before playing, I thought going to another galaxy was just a cop-out after ME3.
  * They managed to make the premise work.
  * The premise lends itself to a different kind of Mass Effect game.
* Sold on Ryder.
  * Good writing.
  * Good female voice acting.
  * Enjoyable character.
* Not sold on most companions. They lack charisma.
* They crammed two games into one. I wish there was MEA 1 about initial exploration and first contact, where the environment is the enemy, and MEA 2 about conflict. MEA has both, not nearly enough of the first, and too much of the second. Missed opportunity.

## Music

* Love the ambient music.
* Hate the combat music.
  * Developers: please let us disable automatic combat music.

## Companions

Competently done but lack charisma compared to ME1/2/3.

Enjoyed squad banter. Would prefer it not limited to Nomad.

## Kinesthetics

### Enjoyable üëç

* Movement options: jetpack, dodge, aim hover.
  * Default too limited. Unfuck with [mods](#mods).
* Hotkeys for everything.
* Ability to remap all hotkeys including UI actions.
* Quality of Ryder animations.
  * Finally got specialized female animations missing from ME2/3.
    * Buggy: many moves start male, switch to female mid-animation.
* Auto-cover.

### Annoying üëé

* Hold button to interact (partially unfuck with [mods](#mods)).
* Loot popup (unfuck with [mods](#mods)).
* UI animations and delays.
* Voice interruptions.
  * Developers: always implement a voice queue!
* Unskippable things: various cutscenes, some dialogs, Tempest transitions, etc.
* Delayed jump animation.
* Slow recovery from landing and dodging.
* Lack of animation canceling.
* Lack of animation overlap, like reloading while sprinting.
* Separation of crafting and loadout UI.
* I-X gear ranks.
  * Constant re-crafting.
  * UI bloat.
  * Inventory micromanagement.
* Slow progression of gear and skills on first playthrough.
* Sucky melee.
* Automatic camera rotation.
* Inconsistent camera sensitivity.
* Unskippable ladder climbing.
* Inability to jump in hubs and Tempest.
  * Mods can fix this for hubs, but not for Tempest.
* Manual door opening.
* Choppy loading of NPCs in hubs. Can see them briefly T-posed.
* Updated dialog options remain greyed-out.
* Banter triggering on fast travel before loading finishes.
* UI bugs that crash or softlock the game.
* Limited life support recovery inside Nomad. Makes no sense.
* Despawn when falling X meters (unfuck with [mods](#mods)).
* Kadara doors (unfuck with [mods](#mods)).
* Slow loading of character previews.
* Lackluster voices for female krogan and salarians.
