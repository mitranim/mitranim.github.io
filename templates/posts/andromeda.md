**TLDR**. Very, very good. Solid sequel. Worthy successor.

* Consistently good writing.
  * 0.0001% tiny blemishes that got overexposed by critics.
* Good mechanics.
  * Advancements on ME2/3.
* Sold on the premise.
  * Before playing, I thought going to another galaxy was a cop-out after ME3.
  * The premise lends itself to a different kind of Mass Effect game.
* Sold on Ryder.
* Not sold on some companions. They lack charisma.
* They crammed two games into one. I wish there was MEA 1 about initial exploration and first contact, where the environment is the enemy, and MEA 2 about conflict. MEA has both, not nearly enough of the first, and too much of the second. Missed opportunity.

## Annoyances

* UI animations and delays.
* Painful crafting and re-crafting.
* Hold button to interact.

## Mods

Credits and resource management tiresome? Don't be ashamed to cheat. Use CheatEngine.
