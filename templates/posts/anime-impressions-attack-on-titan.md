Talk about how impressive Attack on Titan is.

Last remnants of humanity are besieged by "titans", huge creatures that look like naked humans, but without any shred of intellect or even beast-like behavior; their only drive is to kill and "eat" humans. Humans fight back, but have never managed to win any territory back from titans; it's a story of loss and sacrifice, and it's extremely bloody. The "fighting back" part is pretty cool, as they use grappling gear to maneuver in 3D. The titans are really cool because of how human they look and utterly unhuman they behave. I like the setting because of how oppressive it feels, and how it juxtaposes the feeling of the last survivors in a hopeless situation with the peaceful landscape of the rest of the Earth, which seemingly doesn't care about the conflict. Most importantly, particularly in season 1, the characterization is top notch. It avoids standard anime tropes; the writing makes sense in all sorts of ways. Characters are fallible humans, prone to bad decisions and fear. Characters are also smart and make sensible decisions incredibly often, compared to most shows. I lost track of how many times I was astonished by how sensible the characters behaved. It's almost as if the characters made a point to avoid the "idiot hero" or "idiot ball" trope and plug all possible plot holes resulting from the characters acting stupid, at least throughout season 1. It's also a detective story with well-planted hints throughout the show. It gives you clues to figure things out, and rewards taking time to think it through before revealing stuff. Probably rewards rewatching, too. All in all, rather impressive.

This is a minor spoiler, but it averts the "unspoken plan guarantee" trope at least twice. As if the authors specifically made a point to avoid it, maybe even rub this in your face.

Also, it doesn't have scantily clad girls, and protagonists are not high school students.

Oh, and when characters do act stupid, they get brutally punished.

Rewatching Attack on Titan season 1, it's really good at subtle hints. The best way to watch is to pause, pay attention, and think a lot. It really rewards thinking through and figuring things out. Some episodes are so packed with this, it takes longer for me to think about an episode than watch it. Of course this is just a bonus if you're actively looking for clues, can just enjoy the action.

Glad I went back and rewatched Attack on Titan season 1 and 2. There were hints at important plot points that I didn't catch the first time around, but did on the second watch. Took the time, figured it out, got rewarded by being right by later reveals.

Bonus points for how at least one important plot points gets revealed to the characters through an offhand hint that initially seems meant only for the audience, and they also figure it out after taking time to think. I found this really cool.

The show is full of characters smarter than the audience. When given time, the characters _will_ share information and think things through.

Suffering withdrawal now!
