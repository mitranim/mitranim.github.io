## Overview

{{$game := .Site.Games.Get `hogwarts_legacy`}}
{{$game.ImgBox}}
_Hogwarts Legacy_ ([Steam link]({{$game.Link}})) is an open-world adventure in the world of _Harry Potter_, set a full century before the events of the books, with its own story. Combines student life with free-roam open-world exploration and combat. Saturated with lore and flavor. Excellent in most aspects and highly recommended. However, the game does have annoyances, and can be greatly improved with mods, tools, and tweaks.

Incidentally, I also highly recommend the HP books, specifically the UK originals.

## Misc

Check the game's [page on PC Gaming Wiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Legacy) and follow its recommendations.

## Mods

Nexus mods should generally be installed with [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/). When the mod page doesn't offer a Vortex download option, download the archive and use Vortex to install from archive. This method gives you a list of all mods in Vortex, which is very convenient for remembering which mods you have. Some mods have incorrect folder structure and don't actually work when installed this way; you have to disable them in Vortex and then install them manually into the correct folder. Always double check the resulting file placement.
