# •typographic case is a mistake

typographic case has bad combinatorics · it doubles the amount of letters, doubling the work for font creators, increasing the amount of learning, increasing chances of confusion such as collisions between "I"/"l"/"1", making typing harder, and so on

better solution: instead of doubling the amount of letters, define 1 symbol that capitalizes any subsequent word · for example, the following names are capitalized by "•": •london, •madrid, •tokio

also good enough for abbreviations: •wtb, •wts, •wtf, •asap, and so on
