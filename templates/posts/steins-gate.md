**TLDR**. Brought me to tears. Massive emotional impression. Massive food for thought. Highly recommended.

The series consists of games (available on Steam) and anime. The anime is essential. The original game has significant content missing from the anime. Other games are skippable.

Recommended order:

  * Play the original game (available on Steam).
    * The following games are inferior to the original and to their anime versions, and entirely skippable:
      * Steins Gate Elite (remake).
      * Steins Gate 0 (sequel).
  * Watch the anime:
    * Steins Gate: 01—25
    * Steins Gate Movie: Load Region of Deja Vu (can also be watched after series 0)
    * Steins Gate 0: Special 01 (sometimes labeled "episode 23β")
    * Steins Gate 0: 01—24
    * Steins Gate 0: Special 02
  * Play Steins Gate Linear Bounded Phenogram.
